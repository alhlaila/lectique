            <p>Like an apparition, the glimmering
                spectacle of a tall-masted gunship glides
                toward us on the still waters of the
                river Thames. The Fighting Temeraire
                immortalizes the ship on her final journey,
                which took place 33 years after the Battle
                of Trafalgar. The Temeraire had played a
                heroic role in the battle, coming to the aid
                of Lord Nelson’s ship the Victory when it
                was locked in close combat. Despite her
                aura of magnificence, the ship is now in a
                poor state of repair. Stripped of anything
                salvageable, she is being towed from
                Sheerness to Rotherhithe shipyard where
                she will be broken up. A white flag flies
                from the tug, symbolizing the Temeraire’s
                sad surrender to the breaker’s yard.</p>

            <p>
                Although the Union Jack no longer flies
                from the mast, the Temeraire’s past
                bravery is acknowledged by Turner in this
                idealized, theatrical vision. Artistic license
                has allowed him to manipulate events and
                he shows the ship traveling east, with a
                glorious sunset behind her, whereas in
                real life she would have been traveling
                west, as Rotherhithe is west of Sheerness.
                Many factors combine to make this work
                so memorable and moving: the sublime
                setting, the harmonious balance of the
                composition, the extraordinary quality
                of light, and the emotion inherent in
                the visual symbols.</p>
                
                <p>A metaphor for the
                journey of life, the demise of this aged
                sailing ship represents the end of an era;
                even the black buoy in the foreground
                seems to act as a full stop.</p> 
                <p>Turner was in
                his sixties when he made the painting and
                perhaps the powerful sentiments echo his
                own feelings about the passage of time 
                When the work was first exhibited, in
1839 at the Royal Academy in London, the
nostalgia of the occasion was enhanced by
the inclusion in the catalog of two lines
from Thomas Campbell’s emotionally
charged poem Ye Mariners of England:
“The flag which braved the battle and
the breezes, No longer owns her.”</p>

<p>The critics of the day were united in
their praise of a painting that not only
celebrated a contemporary historical
event but also successfully embraced the
techniques of the old masters, particularly
those of Claude, the 17th-century French
landscape painter (c.1604–82), whom
Turner admired. The artist refused to sell
The Fighting Temeraire, calling it “my old
darling”, and the work was recently voted
the most popular painting in Britain.

                left of the painting. Its reflection lights up the water beneath,
                glinting on the rolled-up sails on the masts and on the foam
                churned up by the paddles of the tug. The silvery light reinforces
                the ethereal paleness of the ship and contrasts strongly with the
                fiery tones of the setting sun.</p>

            <p> 2. GHOSTLY SHIP The 98-gun, three-decked Temeraire had
                been moored off the port of Sheerness for several years. Her
                three masts had been removed, together with all her rigging,
                and paint was peeling off her timbers. Turner, however, has
                chosen to present us with an elegant, romantic vision in
                white and gold, complete with masts—a more fitting farewell
                for a ship whose name means bold and fearless</p>

            <p> 3. INDUSTRIAL TUG On the day of
                her final voyage, another boat was
                following the Temeraire. Turner has
                chosen to exclude it, possibly to
                emphasize the contrast between the
                ugly, blackened, steam-powered tug and
                the majestic white sailing ship. The tug
                has been interpreted as a symbol of the
                evils of the British Industrial Revolution
                but Turner’s other work does not support
                this. On the contrary, Turner embraced
                the steam-powered engineering of the
                future in his 1844 painting Rain, Steam
                and Speed—The Great Western Railway,
                a celebration of the age of the train.</p>

            <p> 4. SHIP IN FULL SAIL On the horizon, just to
                the right of the tug, you can just make out the
                shape of another ghostly sailing ship. Turner
                may have included it to remind us how the
                Temeraire must have appeared in her full glory.
                However, this tall-masted ship has almost
                faded from view, so perhaps it serves to
                reinforce the theme of the painting: the end of
                the era of the sailing ship and the irrevocable
                transition to the age of steam power.</p>

            <img class="tem5"  src="Temeraire/5 the sun.jpg">
            <p> 5. FLAMING SUNSET The setting sun is symbolic, representing the
                passing of the age of sail as well as the demise of the Temeraire.
                The blood-red sky, reflected in the surface of the water, perhaps
                reminds us of the sacrifices made by the British navy at the Battle
                of Trafalgar. The Temeraire is positioned well to the left of the
                painting but its visual weight is perfectly balanced by the glowing
                sunset that dominates the whole right side of the composition.
                Notice how thickly the paint has been applied above and around the
                sun, using a technique called impasto</p>

            <p> 6. HUMAN LIFE In the blues and greys
                in the right-hand corner of the painting,
                you can just make out the silhouette of
                a vertical figure standing on a boat. The
                figure has probably been included to give
                an idea of scale and help to establish the
                sheer size of the Temeraire. The boats
                and buildings in the distance also add a
                human element to the painting.</p>

        <p>Turner’s landscapes were influenced by the work
            of <span class="gradient-background">Claude</span>, whose fascination with the qualities of
            light he shared. Turner painted the sun-drenched
            clouds in The Fighting Temeraire using a technique
            he learned from Claude. He applied very thin
            layers of semi-transparent white and yellow oil
            paint over the darker blue, orange, and red to
            give the clouds a translucent appearance.
            Turner left his works to the British nation on
            the understanding that some of them be hung
            next to those of Claude. Dido Building Carthage
            and Sun Rising Through Vapour are displayed
            alongside Claude’s Seaport with <span class="highlight">the Embarkation
                of the Queen of Sheba </span> and <span class="highlight">Landscape
