            <h1>The Fighting Temeraire.<span class="c1839">-1839-</span></h1>
            <p>Like an apparition, the glimmering
                spectacle of a tall-masted gunship glides
                toward us on the still waters of the
                river Thames. The Fighting Temeraire
                immortalizes the ship on her final journey,
                which took place 33 years after the Battle
                of Trafalgar. The Temeraire had played a
                heroic role in the battle, coming to the aid
                of Lord Nelson’s ship the Victory when it
                was locked in close combat. Despite her
                aura of magnificence, the ship is now in a
                poor state of repair. Stripped of anything
                salvageable, she is being towed from
                Sheerness to Rotherhithe shipyard where
                she will be broken up. A white flag flies
                from the tug, symbolizing the Temeraire’s
                sad surrender to the breaker’s yard.</p>

            <h1>A moving tribute</h1>
            <p>
                Although the Union Jack no longer flies
                from the mast, the Temeraire’s past
                bravery is acknowledged by Turner in this
                idealized, theatrical vision. Artistic license
                has allowed him to manipulate events and
                he shows the ship traveling east, with a
                glorious sunset behind her, whereas in
                real life she would have been traveling
                west, as Rotherhithe is west of Sheerness.
                Many factors combine to make this work
                so memorable and moving: the sublime
                setting, the harmonious balance of the
                composition, the extraordinary quality
                of light, and the emotion inherent in
                the visual symbols. A metaphor for the
                journey of life, the demise of this aged
                sailing ship represents the end of an era;
                even the black buoy in the foreground
                seems to act as a full stop. Turner was in
                his sixties when he made the painting and
                perhaps the powerful sentiments echo his
                own feelings about the passage of time 
                When the work was first exhibited, in
1839 at the Royal Academy in London, the
nostalgia of the occasion was enhanced by
the inclusion in the catalog of two lines
from Thomas Campbell’s emotionally
charged poem Ye Mariners of England:
“The flag which braved the battle and
the breezes, No longer owns her.”
The critics of the day were united in
their praise of a painting that not only
celebrated a contemporary historical
event but also successfully embraced the
techniques of the old masters, particularly
those of Claude, the 17th-century French
landscape painter (c.1604–82), whom
Turner admired. The artist refused to sell
The Fighting Temeraire, calling it “my old
darling”, and the work was recently voted
the most popular painting in Britain
