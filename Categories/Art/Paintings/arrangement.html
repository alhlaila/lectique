            <p>Grave and pensive, the elderly woman sits in a
                rigidly formal pose, her hands clasping a white lace
                handkerchief. Her grey hair is flat and neat, her dark
                clothes are plain and puritanical.</p>

                <p>The feeling of austerity is underlined by the subdued color scheme
                and the strong horizontals and verticals of elements
                such as the picture frames, the long curtain, and the
                deep skirting board.</p>

                <p>Yet for all its severity, a sense
                of fragile but dignified humanity glows through the
                painting. Its full title is Arrangement in Grey and
                Black No. 1: Portrait of the Artist’s Mother, but it
                is familiarly known as Whistler’s Mother and has
                become enduringly popular as an archetypal image
                of a sober but sincere matriarch.</p> 
        
                    <h1>Art for art’s sake</h1>


                <p>
                    The artist’s mother, Anna McNeill Whistler (1804–81),
                    was widowed in 1849. She left America in 1863 to
                    escape the Civil War and moved to London to live with
                    her son. A few years after this, he began using musical
                    terms—such as symphony, nocturne, or, as here,
                    arrangement—in the titles of his paintings.</p>
                    
                    <p>This
                    practice expressed his belief that painting was more
                    concerned with formal qualities—lines, shapes, colors—
                    than the ostensible subject. Other artists of the time
                    shared this view, but Whistler was a particularly
                    strong and influential spokesman for the “art for art’s
                    sake” doctrine because of his personal magnetism and
                    his way with words. “As music is the poetry of sound,
                    so is painting the poetry of sight, and the subject
                    matter has nothing to do with the harmony of sound
                    or of color,” he wrote in 1878; and at the same time he
                    commented on this work, “to me it is interesting as a
                    picture of my mother; but what can or ought the
                    public to care about the identity of the portrait?”
                    Arrangement in Grey and Black, No. 1 was first
                    exhibited at the Royal Academy, London, in 1872.</p>
                    <p>
                    Initially the selection committee rejected it, but Sir
                    William Boxall, the Director of the National Gallery,
                    London, and a friend of Whistler, used his influence
                    to have it accepted. In general the portrait was
                    poorly received, but it also had admirers, notably
                    the great writer Thomas Carlyle, who thought it
                    had “massive originality.” Soon afterward, Whistler
                    painted a portrait of Carlyle in a similar vein,
                    Arrangement in Grey and Black, No. 2 (1872–73).
                    In 1891, it was bought by the City of Glasgow in
                    Scotland, making it the first Whistler painting to
                    be acquired by a public collection. This was a
                    milestone in Whistler’s fortunes, and later that year
                    the portrait of his mother was bought by the French
                    state, which had made him a knight of the Légion
                    d’Honneur in 1889.

            <p> 1. CHAIR This is the only inanimate object in the
                painting that deviates slightly from strict angularity.
                Whistler’s favorite form of portrait was the full-length
                standing figure, and initially he is thought to have
                proposed a standing pose for his mother. However, her
                age and a recent illness made this uncomfortable for
                her, so he adopted the sitting pose. Quiet and reserved
                (the opposite of her son), she was a patient model</p>

            <img class="tem2"  src="arrangement/contrast.jpg">
            <p> 2. TONAL CONTRASTS Whistler
                was extraordinarily sensitive to
                tonal values in painting, and here
                he achieves a perfect balance
                of light and dark. He enjoyed
                creating such subtle, low-key
                effects, and his emphasis on the
                flatness of the picture surface,
                rather than three-dimensional
                depth, helped to create the
                conditions from which abstract
                art later emerged. Although
                discreet, Whistler’s art was
                also radical</p>

            <img class="tem3"  src="arrangement/curtains.jpg">
            <p> 3. JAPANESE INFLUENCE
                The curtain is flecked with a
                floral pattern, recalling the
                Japanese screens Whistler
                admired. Japan isolated itself
                from other countries until 1853,
                but in the late 19th century it
                had a major impact on Western
                culture. Whistler collected
                Japanese art and included many
                references to it in his work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content2">
            <img class="tem4"  src="arrangement/feet.jpg">
            <p> 4. FOOTSTOOL The footstool
                provides a note of domesticity
                that slightly softens the overall
                severity of the composition.
                X-rays of the painting show
                that Whistler originally made it
                higher. Changing it was one of
                several alterations he made as
                he worked on the picture: he
                tried out various positions for
                the arms and knees, and he
                originally placed the curtain
                and picture further to the right.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content">
            <img class="tem5"  src="arrangement/hands.jpg">
            <p> 5. HANDS AND HANDKERCHIEF Apart from the head,
                the most detailed and visually forceful element in the
                painting is the area showing the hands clutching
                the handkerchief. Like other portraitists, Whistler
                often used “props”—such as a glove, a hat, or a fan—
                to make the sitter’s hands look naturally occupied.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content2">
            <img class="tem6"  src="arrangement/head.jpg">
            <p> 6. PROFILE Whistler has shown his mother in pure profile. This form
                was much used by Renaissance artists and remained popular in specialist
                types of art such as coins and medals, but by this time it was rarely seen
                in conventional portrait painting. It sets the tone for the formal rigor of
                the picture. The white lace against the black dress recalls the work of
                Frans Hals, an artist whom Whistler admired.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <img class="tem7"  src="arrangement/picture.jpg">
            <p> 5. ETCHING This picture is one of Whistler’s etchings,
                Black Lion Wharf (1859). It was published in 1871 as
                part of a series entitled Sixteen Etchings of Scenes on
                the Thames, which helped establish his reputation as
                a printmaker. Whistler lived near the Thames and the
                river was one of his favorite subjects.</p>

        <p>Turner’s landscapes were influenced by the work
            of Claude, whose fascination with the qualities of
            light he shared. Turner painted the sun-drenched
            clouds in The Fighting Temeraire using a technique
            he learned from Claude. He applied very thin
            layers of semi-transparent white and yellow oil
            paint over the darker blue, orange, and red to
            give the clouds a translucent appearance.
            Turner left his works to the British nation on
            the understanding that some of them be hung
            next to those of Claude. Dido Building Carthage
            and Sun Rising Through Vapour are displayed
