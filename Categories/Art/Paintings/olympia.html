            <p>This beautiful painting is full of movement, color, and
                charming details. From a position in the left-hand
                corner of the room, just behind the piano, you see the
                ballerinas of the Paris Opera in rehearsal. This unusual
                viewpoint helps to create the illusion that you are
                standing next to Degas, sharing his privileged access to
                the ballet class. From the piano, you look along the line
                of dancers right to the back of the room and, like the
                artist, can observe each ballerina in turn.</p>

                <p>
                Degas produced several paintings of the young
                ballerinas of the Paris Opera performing on stage, but
                he much preferred to depict them in the more relaxed
                setting of the rehearsal room, where he was a frequent
                visitor. He spent many hours observing and drawing the
                dancers as they practiced, and it is this sense of being
                present during the ballerinas’ daily routine that gives
                The Dancing Class such an intimate quality.</p>
                
                <p>Although the
                painting appears relaxed and informal, Degas constantly
                refined and perfected his work once he was back in his
                studio. In its apparent spontaneity and realism, the
                painting resembles a snapshot—and Degas was familiar
                with the latest advances in photography—but its
                seemingly casual composition was meticulously
                arranged. X-rays of the painting indicate that some
                figures were moved from one position to another
                until Degas achieved the perfect degree of balance
                and the right atmosphere.</p>
        
                    <h1>Respect for the classics</h1>


                <p>
The Dancing Class is a contemporary scene that
pays homage to the style of the old masters, whose
techniques and draftsmanship Degas greatly admired.
As a young man, he spent a great deal of time in the
Louvre, studying and copying masterpieces by painters
such as Velázquez. It was not until his late twenties,
however, that Degas stopped depicting historical or
mythological themes in his own work and turned his
attention to painting scenes of 19th-century Parisian
society, from horse racing to theater and ballet. </p>

<p>In emulating the style of great classical works but
applying it to less elevated subjects, such as young
girls practicing their dancing skills, Degas was breaking
with convention and his work came under strong
criticism from the French art establishment.</p>
<p>
Degas was the one Impressionist who was successful
from the beginning and, although he remained rather
aloof from them, he did exhibit in group shows. Like
the other Impressionists, he sought to convey a sense of
movement and spontaneity in his work. In The Dancing
Class, the girls appear to have been captured unawares
and their gestures and expressions appear completely
natural, an effect Degas achieves with his superb drawing
skills and confident sense of composition. He also employs
other devices to suggest movement, such as the bright
red accents in the painting that lead from the girl’s hair
decoration and the fan in the foreground to the collar of
the teacher, and then to the sashes of the two dancers
towards the back of the room.</p>

            <p> 1. RISING MOON A sliver of moon is visible in the sky at the top
                left of the painting. Its reflection lights up the water beneath,
                glinting on the rolled-up sails on the masts and on the foam
                churned up by the paddles of the tug. The silvery light reinforces
                the ethereal paleness of the ship and contrasts strongly with the
                fiery tones of the setting sun.</p>

            <p> 2. GHOSTLY SHIP The 98-gun, three-decked Temeraire had
                been moored off the port of Sheerness for several years. Her
                three masts had been removed, together with all her rigging,
                and paint was peeling off her timbers. Turner, however, has
                chosen to present us with an elegant, romantic vision in
                white and gold, complete with masts—a more fitting farewell
                for a ship whose name means bold and fearless</p>

            <p> 3. INDUSTRIAL TUG On the day of
                her final voyage, another boat was
                following the Temeraire. Turner has
                chosen to exclude it, possibly to
                emphasize the contrast between the
                ugly, blackened, steam-powered tug and
                the majestic white sailing ship. The tug
                has been interpreted as a symbol of the
                evils of the British Industrial Revolution
                but Turner’s other work does not support
                this. On the contrary, Turner embraced
                the steam-powered engineering of the
                future in his 1844 painting Rain, Steam
                and Speed—The Great Western Railway,
                a celebration of the age of the train.</p>

            <p> 4. SHIP IN FULL SAIL On the horizon, just to
                the right of the tug, you can just make out the
                shape of another ghostly sailing ship. Turner
                may have included it to remind us how the
                Temeraire must have appeared in her full glory.
                However, this tall-masted ship has almost
                faded from view, so perhaps it serves to
                reinforce the theme of the painting: the end of
                the era of the sailing ship and the irrevocable
                transition to the age of steam power.</p>

                passing of the age of sail as well as the demise of the Temeraire.
                The blood-red sky, reflected in the surface of the water, perhaps
                reminds us of the sacrifices made by the British navy at the Battle
                of Trafalgar. The Temeraire is positioned well to the left of the
                painting but its visual weight is perfectly balanced by the glowing
                sunset that dominates the whole right side of the composition.
                Notice how thickly the paint has been applied above and around the
                sun, using a technique called impasto</p>

            <img class="tem6"  src="The dancing class/the door.jpg">
            <p> 6. HUMAN LIFE In the blues and greys
                in the right-hand corner of the painting,
                you can just make out the silhouette of
                a vertical figure standing on a boat. The
                figure has probably been included to give
                an idea of scale and help to establish the
                sheer size of the Temeraire. The boats
                and buildings in the distance also add a
                human element to the painting.</p>

        <p>Turner’s landscapes were influenced by the work
            of Claude, whose fascination with the qualities of
            light he shared. Turner painted the sun-drenched
            clouds in The Fighting Temeraire using a technique
            he learned from Claude. He applied very thin
            layers of semi-transparent white and yellow oil
            paint over the darker blue, orange, and red to
            give the clouds a translucent appearance.
            Turner left his works to the British nation on
            the understanding that some of them be hung
            next to those of Claude. Dido Building Carthage
            and Sun Rising Through Vapour are displayed
            alongside Claude’s Seaport with <span class="highlight">the Embarkation
                of the Queen of Sheba </span> and <span class="highlight">Landscape
