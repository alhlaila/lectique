            <p>Looks can be deceptive. At first glance, van Gogh’s
                painting of a simple rustic chair appears to be a
                straightforward still life—the kind of picture that
                might have been created in a calm atmosphere, with
                no emotional or symbolic overtones. In reality, it was
                painted just a few weeks before van Gogh’s breakdown,
                at a time when his friendship with Paul Gauguin
                (see pp.182–85) was disintegrating.
                When van Gogh moved to Arles, in the south of France,
                in February 1888 he hoped that it might become the
                center of an artists’ colony. Gauguin’s arrival that year
                seemed a promising start. Van Gogh was delighted. He
                bought furniture for the house and started painting in
                a frenzy, to show the Frenchman how far his art had
                progressed. Unfortunately, it was not long before the
                dream turned sour. Gauguin had come mainly for
                practical reasons, as van Gogh’s brother was helping
                him financially, and he rapidly regretted his decision. He
                disliked the town, feeling “very much a stranger in Arles,”
                and soon quarreled with his host: “Vincent and I generally
                agree on very little, above all when it comes to painting….”
                Van Gogh painted two pictures of chairs—his own and
                Gauguin’s—in early December 1888, when it seemed likely
                that his visitor would leave. It is possible that he thought
                they might persuade Gauguin to stay, but more probable
                that they were a sad acknowledgment of the two men’s
                irreconcilable differences..</p>

            <h1>A coded portrait</h1>
            <p>
                Van Gogh may well have borrowed the idea of using an
                empty chair as a form of symbolic portrait from a wellknown
                illustration by the British artist Luke Fildes,
                showing the chair in which Charles Dickens died.</p>

                
                <p>The
                    objects on Van Gogh’s chairs were definitely designed to identify the sitters. 
                    It is also likely that van Gogh had
                    intended the pictures to be a vindication of his art.
                    Gauguin had encouraged him to paint from imagination,
                    rather than from nature. Van Gogh had tried, but found
                    the results unsatisfactory.</p> 

                <p>So, while Gauguin’s chair was
                    depicted in dark, artificial conditions, his own was plain
                    and simple, but fulfilled all his needs. As such, it echoed
                    his artistic philosophy: “I cannot work without a model…
                    I exaggerate, sometimes I make changes, but I do not
                    invent the whole picture…I find it all ready in nature.</p>

            <p> 1. RISING MOON A sliver of moon is visible in the sky at the top
                left of the painting. Its reflection lights up the water beneath,
                glinting on the rolled-up sails on the masts and on the foam
                churned up by the paddles of the tug. The silvery light reinforces
                the ethereal paleness of the ship and contrasts strongly with the
                fiery tones of the setting sun.</p>

            <p> 2. GHOSTLY SHIP The 98-gun, three-decked Temeraire had
                been moored off the port of Sheerness for several years. Her
                three masts had been removed, together with all her rigging,
                and paint was peeling off her timbers. Turner, however, has
                chosen to present us with an elegant, romantic vision in
                white and gold, complete with masts—a more fitting farewell
                for a ship whose name means bold and fearless</p>

            <p> 3. INDUSTRIAL TUG On the day of
                her final voyage, another boat was
                following the Temeraire. Turner has
                chosen to exclude it, possibly to
                emphasize the contrast between the
                ugly, blackened, steam-powered tug and
                the majestic white sailing ship. The tug
                has been interpreted as a symbol of the
                evils of the British Industrial Revolution
                but Turner’s other work does not support
                this. On the contrary, Turner embraced
                the steam-powered engineering of the
                future in his 1844 painting Rain, Steam
                and Speed—The Great Western Railway,
                a celebration of the age of the train.</p>

            <p> 4. SHIP IN FULL SAIL On the horizon, just to
                the right of the tug, you can just make out the
                shape of another ghostly sailing ship. Turner
                may have included it to remind us how the
                Temeraire must have appeared in her full glory.
                However, this tall-masted ship has almost
                faded from view, so perhaps it serves to
                reinforce the theme of the painting: the end of
                the era of the sailing ship and the irrevocable
                transition to the age of steam power.</p>

                passing of the age of sail as well as the demise of the Temeraire.
                The blood-red sky, reflected in the surface of the water, perhaps
                reminds us of the sacrifices made by the British navy at the Battle
                of Trafalgar. The Temeraire is positioned well to the left of the
                painting but its visual weight is perfectly balanced by the glowing
                sunset that dominates the whole right side of the composition.
                Notice how thickly the paint has been applied above and around the
                sun, using a technique called impasto</p>

                in the right-hand corner of the painting,
                you can just make out the silhouette of
                a vertical figure standing on a boat. The
                figure has probably been included to give
                an idea of scale and help to establish the
                sheer size of the Temeraire. The boats
                and buildings in the distance also add a
                human element to the painting.</p>

        <p>Turner’s landscapes were influenced by the work
            of Claude, whose fascination with the qualities of
            light he shared. Turner painted the sun-drenched
            clouds in The Fighting Temeraire using a technique
            he learned from Claude. He applied very thin
            layers of semi-transparent white and yellow oil
            paint over the darker blue, orange, and red to
            give the clouds a translucent appearance.
            Turner left his works to the British nation on
            the understanding that some of them be hung
            next to those of Claude. Dido Building Carthage
            and Sun Rising Through Vapour are displayed
            alongside Claude’s Seaport with <span class="highlight">the Embarkation
                of the Queen of Sheba </span> and <span class="highlight">Landscape
