            <p>This beautiful painting is full of movement, color, and
                charming details. From a position in the left-hand
                corner of the room, just behind the piano, you see the
                ballerinas of the Paris Opera in rehearsal. This unusual
                viewpoint helps to create the illusion that you are
                standing next to Degas, sharing his privileged access to
                the ballet class. From the piano, you look along the line
                of dancers right to the back of the room and, like the
                artist, can observe each ballerina in turn.</p>

                <p>
                Degas produced several paintings of the young
                ballerinas of the Paris Opera performing on stage, but
                he much preferred to depict them in the more relaxed
                setting of the rehearsal room, where he was a frequent
                visitor. He spent many hours observing and drawing the
                dancers as they practiced, and it is this sense of being
                present during the ballerinas’ daily routine that gives
                The Dancing Class such an intimate quality.</p>
                
                <p>Although the
                painting appears relaxed and informal, Degas constantly
                refined and perfected his work once he was back in his
                studio. In its apparent spontaneity and realism, the
                painting resembles a snapshot—and Degas was familiar
                with the latest advances in photography—but its
                seemingly casual composition was meticulously
                arranged. X-rays of the painting indicate that some
                figures were moved from one position to another
                until Degas achieved the perfect degree of balance
                and the right atmosphere.</p>
        
                    <h1>Respect for the classics</h1>


                <p>
The Dancing Class is a contemporary scene that
pays homage to the style of the old masters, whose
techniques and draftsmanship Degas greatly admired.
As a young man, he spent a great deal of time in the
Louvre, studying and copying masterpieces by painters
such as Velázquez. It was not until his late twenties,
however, that Degas stopped depicting historical or
mythological themes in his own work and turned his
attention to painting scenes of 19th-century Parisian
society, from horse racing to theater and ballet. </p>

<p>In emulating the style of great classical works but
applying it to less elevated subjects, such as young
girls practicing their dancing skills, Degas was breaking
with convention and his work came under strong
criticism from the French art establishment.</p>
<p>
Degas was the one Impressionist who was successful
from the beginning and, although he remained rather
aloof from them, he did exhibit in group shows. Like
the other Impressionists, he sought to convey a sense of
movement and spontaneity in his work. In The Dancing
Class, the girls appear to have been captured unawares
and their gestures and expressions appear completely
natural, an effect Degas achieves with his superb drawing
skills and confident sense of composition. He also employs
other devices to suggest movement, such as the bright
red accents in the painting that lead from the girl’s hair
decoration and the fan in the foreground to the collar of
the teacher, and then to the sashes of the two dancers
towards the back of the room.</p>

            <p> 1. BACK VIEW The dancer in the foreground with
                her back to us enhances the informality of the scene.
                X-rays of the painting show that she was originally the
                other way round, looking out of the painting, but Degas
                changed her position, reinforcing the impression that
                we are actually in the room with him and the dancers
                are oblivious to our presence</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content2">
            <img class="tem2"  src="The dancing class/another girl wee.jpg">
            <p> 2. FRAMED FIGURE Although most of the girls in
                the painting are relaxing, the dancer framed by the
                doorway in the center of the painting is being put
                through her paces by the ballet master. With an
                expression of concentration on her face, she adopts
                a classic ballet position</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content">
            <img class="tem3"  src="The dancing class/hiding girl.jpg">
            <p> 3. CHARMING DETAILS
                Small areas of activity add
                to the informality and
                charm of the painting
                and bring the whole scene
                to life. Behind the girl
                sitting on the piano is
                a dancer playing with
                her pearl earring. This
                intimate detail possibly
                indicates that her
                attention has wandered.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content2">
            <img class="tem4"  src="The dancing class/master.jpg">
            <p> 4. BALLET MASTER As the
                class comes to an end, Jules
                Perrot, the ballet master, leans
                on his wooden stick. He is the
                principal character in the painting
                and the focus of the dancers’
                attention. He appears to be
                instructing the dancer in the
                doorway. Jules Perrot was
                himself a famous dancer and
                is wearing ballet slippers</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content">
            <img class="tem5"  src="The dancing class/rubon.jpg">
            <p> 5. CROPPED EDGES We can see the
                influence of photography in this painting,
                particularly in Degas’ use of cropping—
                cutting off details at the margins. Part of
                the tutu of the girl sitting on the piano
                lies outside the frame. This helps to
                create an air of spontaneity, as if the
                image has been snapped rather than
                carefully composed. The right–hand side
                of the painting is similarly cropped.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content2">
            <img class="tem6"  src="The dancing class/the door.jpg">
            <p> 6. DOORWAY The view
                through the door frame
                draws our gaze beyond
                the rehearsal space to the
                next room. A double bass
                lies next to the doorway,
                so perhaps there is music
                playing. The window in
                the adjoining room is an
                important source of light
                in the composition and
                makes you aware of the
                world outside</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <img class="tem7"  src="The dancing class/the girl wee.jpg">
            <p> 5. TAKING A BREAK These ballerinas appear to be relaxing before
                they perform in front of the ballet master. The three seated girls
                form a triangle, and this shape is repeated by the ballerina standing
                just above them with with her hands on her hips This ballerina’s pose
                echoes that of the dancer with the green sash in the foregroundo</p>

        <p>Turner’s landscapes were influenced by the work
            of Claude, whose fascination with the qualities of
            light he shared. Turner painted the sun-drenched
            clouds in The Fighting Temeraire using a technique
            he learned from Claude. He applied very thin
            layers of semi-transparent white and yellow oil
            paint over the darker blue, orange, and red to
            give the clouds a translucent appearance.
            Turner left his works to the British nation on
            the understanding that some of them be hung
            next to those of Claude. Dido Building Carthage
            and Sun Rising Through Vapour are displayed
            alongside Claude’s Seaport with <span class="highlight">the Embarkation
