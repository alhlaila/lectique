            <p>These nude figures have such timeless grandeur that
                they seem to be “sliced out of mountain rock.” The
                memorable phrase comes from the great English sculptor
                Henry Moore, who first saw the painting in 1922, when
                he was a student. It made an indelible mark on him,
                and 40 years later he recalled, “For me this was like
                seeing Chartres Cathedral.” Many other
                artists and critics have expressed similar
                feelings of awe about this picture—the largest
                Cézanne ever painted and one of
                the culminating works of his career. In it
                he combined majesty of form with subtle
                beauty of color and atmosphere, achieving
                his goal—in his own much-quoted words—“to
                make of Impressionism something solid and
                enduring, like the art of the museums.</p> 
                <p>
                    Figures in a landscape
The young Cézanne had a fiery temperament,
and his early work included highly emotional
scenes of violence and suffering. In the 1870s,
however, he abandoned such subjects as he
came under the influence of Impressionism.
From this time his art was based almost
entirely on the people and places of the
world around him, but there was one
imaginative theme that he did not give
up—groups of nude figures in a landscape
setting. He depicted such figures, generally
called “Bathers,” throughout his career, in
well over a hundred oils, watercolors, and
drawings. The groups are usually exclusively
male or female. Originally the scenes of
female bathers were slightly erotic in feeling,
but—as with his other subjects—they became
mainly a vehicle for stylistic exploration.
Most of these works are fairly small, but
in the final decade of his life Cézanne painted
three large oils of female bathers that rank
among his most ambitious works. The other
two are in the Barnes Foundation, Merion,
Pennsylvania, US, and the National Gallery,
London. These two were possibly begun as
early as about 1895 and were still being
worked on by Cézanne just before his death
in 1906 (it is often difficult to date his
paintings because he worked slowly and
sometimes intermittently, putting them aside
for a time and then taking them up again).
The Philadelphia painting, on the other hand, may belong
entirely to the final year of Cézanne’s life and was
unfinished when he died.

                <p>
                    Subtle brushwork
It is the grandest of the three paintings, the most serene
and exalted in feeling, and the most beautiful and subtle
in brushwork (in spite of its unfinished state). The whole
surface is alive with vibrant touches, and the figures are
wonderfully harmonized with their setting, as if sky, trees,
and human flesh were all made of the same mysterious
substance. This concern with the overall feel and balance
of the picture surface was at the heart of Cézanne’s great
legacy to modern art. It led the way from naturalism to
such developments as Cubism and abstract art.é"

            <p> 1. RISING MOON A sliver of moon is visible in the sky at the top
                left of the painting. Its reflection lights up the water beneath,
                glinting on the rolled-up sails on the masts and on the foam
                churned up by the paddles of the tug. The silvery light reinforces
                the ethereal paleness of the ship and contrasts strongly with the
                fiery tones of the setting sun.</p>

            <p> 2. GHOSTLY SHIP The 98-gun, three-decked Temeraire had
                been moored off the port of Sheerness for several years. Her
                three masts had been removed, together with all her rigging,
                and paint was peeling off her timbers. Turner, however, has
                chosen to present us with an elegant, romantic vision in
                white and gold, complete with masts—a more fitting farewell
                for a ship whose name means bold and fearless</p>

            <p> 3. INDUSTRIAL TUG On the day of
                her final voyage, another boat was
                following the Temeraire. Turner has
                chosen to exclude it, possibly to
                emphasize the contrast between the
                ugly, blackened, steam-powered tug and
                the majestic white sailing ship. The tug
                has been interpreted as a symbol of the
                evils of the British Industrial Revolution
                but Turner’s other work does not support
                this. On the contrary, Turner embraced
                the steam-powered engineering of the
                future in his 1844 painting Rain, Steam
                and Speed—The Great Western Railway,
                a celebration of the age of the train.</p>

            <p> 4. SHIP IN FULL SAIL On the horizon, just to
                the right of the tug, you can just make out the
                shape of another ghostly sailing ship. Turner
                may have included it to remind us how the
                Temeraire must have appeared in her full glory.
                However, this tall-masted ship has almost
                faded from view, so perhaps it serves to
                reinforce the theme of the painting: the end of
                the era of the sailing ship and the irrevocable
                transition to the age of steam power.</p>

                passing of the age of sail as well as the demise of the Temeraire.
                The blood-red sky, reflected in the surface of the water, perhaps
                reminds us of the sacrifices made by the British navy at the Battle
                of Trafalgar. The Temeraire is positioned well to the left of the
                painting but its visual weight is perfectly balanced by the glowing
                sunset that dominates the whole right side of the composition.
                Notice how thickly the paint has been applied above and around the
                sun, using a technique called impasto</p>

                in the right-hand corner of the painting,
                you can just make out the silhouette of
                a vertical figure standing on a boat. The
                figure has probably been included to give
                an idea of scale and help to establish the
                sheer size of the Temeraire. The boats
                and buildings in the distance also add a
                human element to the painting.</p>

        <p>Turner’s landscapes were influenced by the work
            of Claude, whose fascination with the qualities of
            light he shared. Turner painted the sun-drenched
            clouds in The Fighting Temeraire using a technique
            he learned from Claude. He applied very thin
            layers of semi-transparent white and yellow oil
            paint over the darker blue, orange, and red to
            give the clouds a translucent appearance.
            Turner left his works to the British nation on
            the understanding that some of them be hung
            next to those of Claude. Dido Building Carthage
            and Sun Rising Through Vapour are displayed
            alongside Claude’s Seaport with <span class="highlight">the Embarkation
