            <p>Propaganda rarely produces great art, but this is a
                notable exception. In this stark yet moving picture,
                David mourns the death of a close friend and fellow
                revolutionary. The victim, Jean-Paul Marat, was a leading
                member of the National Convention—the short-lived
                governing body in France during the Reign of Terror, the
                most violent days of the Revolution. His extreme views
                made him many enemies, particularly after the fall of the
                Girondins (one of the more moderate factions).</p>

                <p>
                    On July 13, 1793, one of their supporters, a young
                    woman named Charlotte Corday, was granted an audience
                    with him in his bathroom. This was not unusual. Marat
                    suffered from a debilitating skin condition that required
                    him to take frequent baths, so he used the place as an
                    office. During the meeting, Corday pulled out a knife and
                    stabbed him to death. At her trial, she proclaimed, “I killed
                    one man to save 100,000 lives.” On July 17, she was sent
                    to the guillotine.</p>
        
                    <h1>A revolutionary tribute</h1>


                <p>On the day after Marat’s murder, David was invited by the
                    Convention to arrange the funeral ceremony and to paint
                    a memorial for the dead man. He began work immediately
                    and had completed the picture by November. David was
                    the obvious choice for this task, partly because he knew
                    Marat very well and shared his ideals, and partly because
                    his rigorous, Neoclassical style was well suited to the
                    moral gravitas required for such a theme. </p>

<p>David stripped the scene down to its essentials. He
    removed the ornate decor of Marat’s bathroom and
    replaced it with a darkened void. This may have been
    inspired by the gloomy lighting in the Cordeliers (a former
    church), where the victim’s body lay in state. David
    exchanged Marat’s unusual, boot-shaped bath for a more
    traditional design and focused the viewer’s attention on
    the limp, dangling arm in the foreground, deliberately
    conjuring up associations with the pose of Christ’s body
    as he was lowered from the Cross.</p>
<p>
    The artist may also
    have been inspired by memories of an ancient sculpted
    relief known as the Bed of Polycleitus. After the
    Revolution, the painting proved an embarrassment to the new regime and in 1795 it was returned to David.
    It was not exhibited again in France until 1846, 21 years
    after David’s death, when the poet and art critic Charles
    Baudelaire’s lyrical praise restored its reputation.</p>

            <p> 1. RISING MOON A sliver of moon is visible in the sky at the top
                left of the painting. Its reflection lights up the water beneath,
                glinting on the rolled-up sails on the masts and on the foam
                churned up by the paddles of the tug. The silvery light reinforces
                the ethereal paleness of the ship and contrasts strongly with the
                fiery tones of the setting sun.</p>

            <p> 2. GHOSTLY SHIP The 98-gun, three-decked Temeraire had
                been moored off the port of Sheerness for several years. Her
                three masts had been removed, together with all her rigging,
                and paint was peeling off her timbers. Turner, however, has
                chosen to present us with an elegant, romantic vision in
                white and gold, complete with masts—a more fitting farewell
                for a ship whose name means bold and fearless</p>

            <p> 3. INDUSTRIAL TUG On the day of
                her final voyage, another boat was
                following the Temeraire. Turner has
                chosen to exclude it, possibly to
                emphasize the contrast between the
                ugly, blackened, steam-powered tug and
                the majestic white sailing ship. The tug
                has been interpreted as a symbol of the
                evils of the British Industrial Revolution
                but Turner’s other work does not support
                this. On the contrary, Turner embraced
                the steam-powered engineering of the
                future in his 1844 painting Rain, Steam
                and Speed—The Great Western Railway,
                a celebration of the age of the train.</p>

            <p> 4. SHIP IN FULL SAIL On the horizon, just to
                the right of the tug, you can just make out the
                shape of another ghostly sailing ship. Turner
                may have included it to remind us how the
                Temeraire must have appeared in her full glory.
                However, this tall-masted ship has almost
                faded from view, so perhaps it serves to
                reinforce the theme of the painting: the end of
                the era of the sailing ship and the irrevocable
                transition to the age of steam power.</p>

                passing of the age of sail as well as the demise of the Temeraire.
                The blood-red sky, reflected in the surface of the water, perhaps
                reminds us of the sacrifices made by the British navy at the Battle
                of Trafalgar. The Temeraire is positioned well to the left of the
                painting but its visual weight is perfectly balanced by the glowing
                sunset that dominates the whole right side of the composition.

                in the right-hand corner of the painting,
                you can just make out the silhouette of
                a vertical figure standing on a boat. The
                figure has probably been included to give
                an idea of scale and help to establish the
                sheer size of the Temeraire. The boats
                and buildings in the distance also add a
                human element to the painting.</p>

        <p>Turner’s landscapes were influenced by the work
            of Claude, whose fascination with the qualities of
            light he shared. Turner painted the sun-drenched
            clouds in The Fighting Temeraire using a technique
            he learned from Claude. He applied very thin
            layers of semi-transparent white and yellow oil
            paint over the darker blue, orange, and red to
            give the clouds a translucent appearance.
            Turner left his works to the British nation on
            the understanding that some of them be hung
            next to those of Claude. Dido Building Carthage
            and Sun Rising Through Vapour are displayed
            alongside Claude’s Seaport with <span class="highlight">the Embarkation
                of the Queen of Sheba </span> and <span class="highlight">Landscape
