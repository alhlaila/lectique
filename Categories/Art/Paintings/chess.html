            <p>These nude figures have such timeless grandeur that
                they seem to be “sliced out of mountain rock.” The
                memorable phrase comes from the great English sculptor
                Henry Moore, who first saw the painting in 1922, when
                he was a student. It made an indelible mark on him,
                and 40 years later he recalled, “For me this was like
                seeing Chartres Cathedral.” Many other
                artists and critics have expressed similar
                feelings of awe about this picture—the largest
                Cézanne ever painted and one of
                the culminating works of his career. In it
                he combined majesty of form with subtle
                beauty of color and atmosphere, achieving
                his goal—in his own much-quoted words—“to
                make of Impressionism something solid and
                enduring, like the art of the museums.</p> 
                <p>
                    Figures in a landscape
The young Cézanne had a fiery temperament,
and his early work included highly emotional
scenes of violence and suffering. In the 1870s,
however, he abandoned such subjects as he
came under the influence of Impressionism.
From this time his art was based almost
entirely on the people and places of the
world around him, but there was one
imaginative theme that he did not give
up—groups of nude figures in a landscape
setting. He depicted such figures, generally
called “Bathers,” throughout his career, in
well over a hundred oils, watercolors, and
drawings. The groups are usually exclusively
male or female. Originally the scenes of
female bathers were slightly erotic in feeling,
but—as with his other subjects—they became
mainly a vehicle for stylistic exploration.
Most of these works are fairly small, but
in the final decade of his life Cézanne painted
three large oils of female bathers that rank
among his most ambitious works. The other
two are in the Barnes Foundation, Merion,
Pennsylvania, US, and the National Gallery,
London. These two were possibly begun as
early as about 1895 and were still being
worked on by Cézanne just before his death
in 1906 (it is often difficult to date his
paintings because he worked slowly and
sometimes intermittently, putting them aside
for a time and then taking them up again).
The Philadelphia painting, on the other hand, may belong
entirely to the final year of Cézanne’s life and was
unfinished when he died.

                    Subtle brushwork
It is the grandest of the three paintings, the most serene
and exalted in feeling, and the most beautiful and subtle
in brushwork (in spite of its unfinished state). The whole
surface is alive with vibrant touches, and the figures are
wonderfully harmonized with their setting, as if sky, trees,
and human flesh were all made of the same mysterious
substance. This concern with the overall feel and balance
of the picture surface was at the heart of Cézanne’s great
legacy to modern art. It led the way from naturalism to
such developments as Cubism and abstract art.é"
